DocumentService provides a DataStore abstraction, DocumentStore, which holds data about entities within Documents. A document can represent data about anything - e.g. a player, a group, or a virtual house shared between players. DocumentStores can be session-locked or not session-locked. DocumentStores which aren't session locked are designed to be used for shared data which needs multiple-server editing. This will disable some methods, such as caching - you should write directly to the DataStore every time you make an update. You should use session locking where you can to take full advantage of the library. See README.md for more information.","keywords":""},{"title":"Developer Products","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/DocumentService/docs/products","content":"Developer Products There is no example here yet.

Yields &lt;/&gt; Document.Read(self: Document&lt;T&gt;) → Result&lt;any,RobloxAPIError | SchemaError | CheckError | BackwardsCompatibilityError&gt; Reads the latest data stored in Data Stores. Runs migrations and the check function, but does not save changes. This may be called while the document is not open. warning A SchemaError will be returned if document has never been opened before, so it is strongly recommended to handle this case, and Open the document before reading it if possible. This includes when migrating from no library. Runs Read hooks.
